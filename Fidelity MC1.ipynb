    "    Fidelity Investments is a investment firm\n",

    "    The main challenge Fidelity has are the high cost of fees with thier product and services. Fidelity offers a competetive hgih rate for their index funds and ETF's. Competetiors such as Vanguard and Charles Schwab are Fidelities biggest threats when it comes to index fund fees offering much lower rates. Fideliety targets long term investors with its great trade executions and excellent research and asset screeners.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Fidelity has a strong advantage over its competetors due to the amount of accounts it has which is well over 40 million accounts throughout all products and services. add that with being privately held makes it difficult for competetors to present danger. Fidelity currently has its hands on technology to help increase collaboration, optimize production, and deepen the client engagement experience to all. Cloud computing is a big step Fidelity is taking to make the scale more secured, safe, and cost efficient. A.I and Machine learning are also a part of Fidelity technology they are using while using a Regtech company Saifr to overlook their compliance management operations automatically. Fidelity also uses Machine learning to develop chat box's and analyze data for more accurate investment decisions. Fidelity uses a variety of tech that includes, java, JQuery, Bootstrap, Highcharts, and Ensighten.\n"

    "    With Fidelity being a leader in the wealth management domain, the firm was able to keep up with the joneses by coming up with innovative and effective solutions over the past 5 to 10 years. Fidelity was able to be very effective in their industry by implementing Fidelity's robo advisor as Fidelity Go. Also there is Fidelity Labs where technologists work together on various projects using A.I and blockchain to bring the most valuable and impactful ideas to life. Even while Fidelity has a lot to offer, this firm is still not safe as other fintech companies such as betterment, Sofi, and Wealthfront where they are more focused on products like robo advisors, cybersecurity, and digital wealth management platforms.\n",

    "    According to the 2022 annaul report, Fidelit's largest impact was their revenue generating over $25 billion dollars which was over 5% more than the year before. Fidelity acheived this feat by the demand for more retirement accounts which is Fidelities specialty long term investing. Not only have they increased revenue, they also expanded its presence with new offices in Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Fidelity measures its value of success through AUM (Asset under management) where they have exceeded over $10 trillion and customer satisfaction based on the amount of satisfied clients they serve to help reach financial freedom. Based on Fidelities performance among the wealth management domain, the firm still remains as a dominant leader in the domain backing up with the number of clients both business and indivduals along with the AUM and revenue numbers fully committing to their platform. \n",

    " ### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "    By examining Fidelities reports and articles, we have gained valuable insights into what product or services that can help the firm keep up with trends. Fidelity can stay in flexible by staying innovative through the use of a more user-friendly trading platform. Most of the firms competetors have a execellent trading platform for traders thats easy to use and accessible since Fidelity is more common for long term investors in retirements and college savings accounts. Using tools such as A.I, cybersecurity, and machine learning are all phenomenal tools that Fidelity already utilize to stay in good hands. These technmologies are what most competitors are using in their trading platforms that give them an edge in the wealth management domain let alone the fintech industry. "
